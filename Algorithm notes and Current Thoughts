Algorithm notes
    Value the center first. In case of a tie, the closer to the center the better.
    If the number shown is the same as the number of unknown boxes around it, each of those unknown boxes have 100%
    So first, the algorithm will mark any bombs that have 100% chance of being chosen.
    If a number n has n bombs already found around it, then all other boxes around it are clear.
    If known bomb, right click. If known safe, left click.
    If there is a flag, NEVER, EVER CLICK IT.

Current thoughts
    Need to test to see which has the highest confidence scaling
    Testing to make sure we get the correct number of boxes
    Need to make functions cleaner
